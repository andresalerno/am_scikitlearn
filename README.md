### Hi my friends! ðŸ‘‹

If you have not known me yet, please check it out my profile describe [here](https://github.com/andresalerno).

After a long period of time working with R Programming and their packages (mainly in the ML features), in this repo I've decided studying the modeling conceptuals using Python.

It is importante important to mention that this kick off was able using the amazing knowledge from [AnÃ¡lise Macro](https://analisemacro.com.br/).

So, let's do it some ðŸ¤– Machine Learning works!
